        <h2>thoughts on mindy kaling's never have i ever</h2>
        <div class ="postbody">
            I finished watching Mindy Kaling's latest Netflix show Never Have I Ever a few days ago, and since then have had<br>
            a myriad of mixed feelings regarding the show and its representation of Tamil and South Asian culture. After<br> seeing numerous posts regarding this polarizing topic on Subtle Tamil Traits among other pages, I decided I'd<br> write one of my own to try and make sense of my thoughts.<br>

        no voices, no breaths <br>
        only shattered glass and the blood stained floor <br>
        paramedics trying to piece together <br>
        broken bodies, broken hearts, and missing identities <br>
        bullets fired
        the ring ring ring of loved ones reaching out<br>
        but there's no one who can answer. <br>

      sydney's voice drifts from a steady narration to silence, <br>
      my phone telling me that it's time to try and sleep, <br>
      fifteen minutes have passed. <br>
      my eyelids, once filled with sydney's story, now flutter open <br>
      my feathery pillowcase cushioning the landing into this world. <br>
