<h1>poetry</h1>

<h2><b>three ways of looking at an iphone</b></h2>
<p><i>I</i><br>
no voices, no breaths <br>
only shattered glass and the blood stained floor <br>
paramedics trying to piece together <br>
broken bodies, broken hearts, and missing identities <br>
bullets fired
the ring ring ring of loved ones reaching out<br>
but there's no one who can answer.<br></p>
<p><i>II</i><br>
heads down, fingers tapping<br>
feet moving on this ground,<br>
but my head's in another place<br>
typing what i meant to say,<br>
saying what i meant to type<br>
how is it that i am here with you now, but listening to what they have to say?<br></p>
<p><i>III</i><br>
a wall of protection<br>
where we can put ourselves out there,<br>
without really having to be out there.<br>
voices, words and photos i would never show in person,<br>
voices, words and photos that they are not in person. <br>
yet fingers scrolling, we compare,<br>
feeling too skinny, too old, too fond of dessert<br>
delete, and repost<br>
only to realize the filter is a shade too dark.</p>
