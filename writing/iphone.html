                <h4>a medley of 2 a.m. thoughts</h4>
                <div class ="postbody">
                <i>I</i><br>
                no voices, no breaths <br>
                only shattered glass and the blood stained floor <br>
                paramedics trying to piece together <br>
                broken bodies, broken hearts, and missing identities <br>
                bullets fired
                the ring ring ring of loved ones reaching out<br>
                but there's no one who can answer. <br>
                <i>II</i><br>
                heads down, fingers tapping<br>
                feet moving on this ground,<br>
                but my head's in another place<br>
                typing what i meant to say,<br>
                saying what i meant to type<br>
                how is it that i am here with you now, but listening to what they have to say?<br>
                <i>III</i><br>
                a wall of protection<br>
                where we can put ourselves out there,<br>
                without really having to be out there.<br>
                voices, words and photos i would never show in person,<br>
                voices, words and photos that they are not in person. <br>
                yet fingers scrolling, we compare,<br>
                feeling too skinny, too old, too fond of dessert<br>
                delete, and repost<br>
                only to realize the filter is a shade too dark.
