               heart's racing trying to go faster so they'll stop honking<br>

                even though it's a red light, there's nowhere i can go <br>

                pushing through the headlights all so i can get to alfred coffee<br> 

                and buy my seven dollar coffee as a pick me up <br>

                before their seven pm closing <br>


                rummaging through store labels<br>

                keto, paleo, ingredients invalidated<br>

                as fast as the salads are restocked<br>


                anxiety through traffic to get to work<br>

                work to pay for overpriced vegan coffee<br>

                so that i'll have the energy to restart<br>


                because it's as if once you know this lifestyle<br>

                starbucks just won't do<br>
