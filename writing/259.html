                sydney's voice drifts from a steady narration to silence, <br>

                my phone telling me that it's time to try and sleep,<br>

                fifteen minutes have passed. <br>


                my eyelids, once filled with sydney's story, now flutter open<br>

                my feathery pillowcase cushioning the landing into this world.<br>


                thoughts, worries, questions, gratitude <br>

                from yesterday, about tomorrow, <br>

                cloud my mind like a stream of bubbles, <br>

                i'm unsure which ones to pop, which ones to save. <br>

                or maybe i should just let them all rise,<br>

                knowing they will manifest in their own time. <br>


                i shift my alarm back another fifteen <br>

                wishful thinking that the next time i am awake, <br>

                it will not be 3:59 am.<br>
