                she's taught that no means no,<br>
                that nothing means no,<br>
                why she didn't say no?<br>
                but how could she say no<br>
                when she couldn't even speak?<br>
                how could she prove her words<br>
                when she didn't see it coming?<br>
                was she supposed to document it<br>
                even when she was too frightened to fight?<br>
                or should she have seen it coming,<br>
                because she's been taught<br>
                to stay in after eight, and<br>
                to pull her shirt until they reach<br>
                the waistline of her pants<br>
                while he's been taught<br>
                that his medals weigh more than his character,<br>
                and that crimes are innocent<br>
                when they've been laced with a bit of tequila<br>
                while she's been asked<br>
                not what he did to her, not if she's okay<br>
                but where she went to get tacos,<br>
                which toppings she chose, and when she had tacos<br>
                she's probably wishing she hadn't gone to get tacos<br>
                more than she wishes she hadn't gone to that party.<br>
