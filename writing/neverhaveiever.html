I finished watching Mindy Kaling's latest Netflix show Never Have I Ever a few days ago, and since then have had a myriad of <br>mixed feelings regarding the show and its representation of Tamil and South Asian culture. After seeing <br>numerous posts regarding this polarizing topic on Subtle Tamil Traits among other pages, I decided I'd write one of my own to try and make<br> sense of my thoughts. <br><br>


For a bit of background, I come from a Tamil family and have been raised in the South Bay in California, a town with a <br>majority Asian demographic. I understand that this upbringing affects how I view the show, and how much I can or <br>cannot relate to the cultural aspects. I would recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it, as it's been interesting to <br>hear how people's opinions of it differ based on their upbringing, all while celebrating the first Netflix show <br>telling the story of a Tamil girl!<br><br>

<div class="section">things i loved ...</div><br><br>


<div class="section">casting</div> Devi is played by Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, a female of Tamil descent, and is played by someone who looks <br>Tamil. I thought that casting someone with a darker skin tone to play Devi and her family members was a great <br>step towards fighting colorism in the film industry, something that we are yet to see in many Bollywood films. Growing up in <br>America, I've also definitely had experiences where people did not know that other Indian languages except Hindi<br> even existed, so casting a girl of Tamil descent really brings to light the diversity present within India. <br><br>


<div class="section">addressing mental health</div> Much of the storyline revolves around the untimely death of Devi's father, and how <br>her loss has impacted her relationships with her friends and family. Devi is seen going to counseling appointments <br>frequently to work through this loss, and I felt that this was an important breakthrough in addressing mental health <br>stigma in the South Asian community and in normalizing therapy as a method of relieving emotional distress. I can relate<br> to the fact that mental health issues are often shoved under the rug in South Asian families, partly due to a fear of how <br>acknowledgement of a mental health condition can affect a family's social reputation and idea of success. Seeing not only <br>Devi but also her mother grow to accept therapy as a valid form of treatment was crucial in fighting this stigma, and helped <br> me as a viewer better empathize with Devi's actions and the sequence of events that may have influenced them. <br><br>


<div class="section">voice</div> I really enjoyed the voice as it accurately represented the fears and commonly "cringey" thoughts of any <br>high schooler who is struggling to balance grades, reputations and relationships with the growing checklist of <br>their parents' expectations. <br><br>


<div class="section">plot line with her father</div> I thought the story with her father was portrayed so beautifully, especially with <br>the way the flashbacks became increasingly intense and complete as she came closer to accepting his death. I definitely <br>teared up at the end seeing her come closer to her mother, and this storyline allowed me to empathize with her character's <br>seemingly erratic actions throughout the series. <br><br>


<div class="section">things i wish had been portrayed differently ...</div> <br><br>


<div class="section">narration</div> Though I understand the significance of John McEnroe in the storyline, I wish that the narration <br>had been done by someone of South Asian descent. There were parts in the narration where Tamil words were mispronounced, <br>and I felt that having a white male narrate the story of a South Asian female reinforced the pattern of  history being <br>told by the "victors". <br><br>


<div class="section">arranged marriage</div> I was discussing this show with a friend after we had both watched it, and she brought up <br>the point that Kamala not knowing how Prashant looked until they met in person was pretty unlikely in this generation, as<br> with technology and social media she would have been able to see a picture or speak with him in person prior to this. I <br>also do wish that we had seen more from Kamala's character apart from her storyline about arranged marriage. I understand <br>this is definitely still a huge part of many Indian families living in America, but including bits of what else she brought<br> to the table (whether that be her education at CalTech or her thoughts on different Bollywood movies rather than <br>Riverdale) would help propagate the idea that an Indian woman's value and destiny in this generation holds more than her <br>inevitable marriage to a male engineer. <br><br>


<div class="section">accents</div> This may simply be because I am used to hearing accents that sound different than that of Devi's dad,<br> but I wish that Mohan's accent and language had been portrayed more accurately. I liked that he used words such as<br> "kanna" which are often used in Tamil households, but I felt that his accent and frequent use of the phrase "my love" or <br>mispronunciation of the word "thakkali sambhar" felt unusual and more westernized than that of someone raised in <br>India. Still, I understand that accents and language are largely impacted by where we are raised, and that differs from family to <br>family. (Also, is it just me or is anyone else confused about why Ben called Devi "David" the whole season?) <br><br>


<div class="section">character growth regarding culture</div> From the start of the season to the end, I did not feel like we saw <br>much change in terms of how Devi viewed her ethnicity. Though this is a change that takes much longer than the time in <br>which the season was set, I believe that adding subtle elements of Indian culture that a teen would view as appealing such <br> as cooking, Indian sweet or savory snacks, or native songs and movies would have helped both Devi and viewers who<br> identify with her find parts of Indian culture that are enjoyable rather than merely stereotypical. If a viewer could see that <br>Devi had began to embrace her culture, they would feel empowered and supported in doing so. In other words, I felt that <br>while this show portrayed stereotypes and a hatred for your own roots that many Indian-Americans do face, it could have <br>done more to show how one could begin the process of accepting and embracing one's own South Indian heritage. <br><br>


<div class="section">representation of friend groups</div> Throughout the season, we didn't see Devi have other Indian friends her age <br>at school or see any of Indian family friends. As she is from a suburb of Los Angeles, it seemed unlikely that she <br>was the only student of Indian ethnicity at her school or that her family didn't have any Indian family friends, which made <br>her isolation seem more extreme than realistic. This could of course be seen from a different angle that her <br>embarrassment about her ethnicity caused her to distance herself from other South Asian students. <br> <br>


<div class="section">south indian cultural elements</div> I really liked that Devi was shown wearing a half saree, a traditional Tamil <br>attire. But, I wish that we had seen other traditional South Indian pujas rather than only Ganesh Puja (which is <br>typically celebrated in Maharashtra) and could have heard Tamil songs in the soundtrack rather than Nagada Sang Dhol or <br>other Bollywood music. Pragathi Guruprasad, a Tamil singer with carnatic training, had a cameo in this scene, and having <br>her sing during the puja would have been another subtle way to introduce South Indian culture. Additionally, the word chai<br> is used in her household, one that I felt was more prevalent in North Indian households (my family generally just says <br>"tea" instead); this could be a great place to introduce payasam, the Tamil word for a traditional Indian pudding. <br>Additionally, I felt that the choice to cast Richa Shukla Moorjani, a North Indian-American,in the role of Kamala, a Tamil<br> girl from India, was not very appropriate. I felt that this reinforced the issue of colorism in the film industry, and the<br> casting of a Tamil actress to play the role would have helped aid this issue. I have definitely had points in my life <br>where I wished that I was born in a North Indian family as I yearned for the weddings and attire glorified in Bollywood <br>films. But, an inability to relate to many of these films allowed me to understand how beautifully unique each part of <br>India is. An emphasis on this in future seasons would help improve the prevalence and representation of South Indian <br>culture in the film industry as well. <br><br>


I understand that as someone who was raised in a primarily South Asian community, my story is much different than that of <br>Devi; Devi's story is just one of many in this community. The above are simply my personal opinions regarding the show. I <br>still believe that this show was an undeniable breakthrough in the industry, being one of the first to tell the story of a <br>Tamil girl navigating the rough waters of high school and South Asian parental expectations.<br><br>
